# DataStructures
This repository contains work on different Data Structures and different Graph implementations in C.

At least for now, I do not intend to have any explanation on how each of the Data Structures work or behave.
This repository only contains code and it is highly recommended to study the theory behind each structure before loooking at the code itself.
